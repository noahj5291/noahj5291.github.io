This week we start on our flags again and this time I am using the UK flag as the one I will make. So far I have been thinking a lot about the the layering in which the flag should be in and what I should start with. In our flag we have a lot of measurements to make sure Our flag is an exact replica of the flag. The background will be blue to avoid many triangles and small blue parts on the flag. It will be a 300 by 200 flag where the vertical white lines are 1/5 of the width in the center. The horizontal white lines are 1/3 of the hieght and the full length  of the flag. Then the two diagnol white lines are 3/25 going diagnol. Both white lines having a 1/3 red line running threw them. Finally the red lines on the horizoltal and vertical white lines are 12/20 of the line.

This week I had a problem with noticing the second step in the layering. When it came to the vertical or diaginal first I didnt know which one. I asked and the question of which overroad the other. Then I found out that is I was to do things over again i would need to put the diagonal lines first. The red and white ones so that I could make an accurate flag.
