This week in AP CSP we did some test to better understand our knowledge of the content this year. I feel as if I did really well but that is not the main focus of the exam. I saw from this test the reason of the mastery skils 1 5 and 3. See somethings the college board asks for is also connected to our schools expectations and we focused on those masteryskills in this test. 

In this 29 question test there was one question that was very interesting when we got the data back on the percentages of people that got right and wrong. This question number 20 seemed to stump many people. Question 20 was a Mastery skill 1 question that asks you to interpret and asign a variable name to the changing value. Most people said that name of the changing value should be the product of the function, In actuallity that changing value should be named after the data being used to use the function. People thought the changing value of the function was the the product because we know what we wanted out of the function so we thought you had t use it to get it.

All in all this question helped me learn that we need to take our time to really analyis the problem and understand the function. This was a big part of my week in AP CSP.
