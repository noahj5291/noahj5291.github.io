This year in Ap CSP I learned a lot about how abstraction and data is used in code. This class has further expanded my love and understanding of computer science. I have coded multiple functions to help understand data and also wrote funtions to combine functions to make images like my flag. Overall I dont have a lot to say about this year but i can say that it has been fun and educational. I do not feel very confident in getting college credit for my school year but it was still worth the knowledge.
