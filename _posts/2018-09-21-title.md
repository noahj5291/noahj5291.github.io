Week 1,
   Starting off with this class I think it will be a pretty good and challenging class. Learning new things in the coding is always fun and I'm excited to further my knowledge in this field. This is going to be a hard class and a even harder test. From what we have done so far I'm feeling like I can coast by and do good but I know that is not the case in this class. I'm ready to get into some hard and complicated stuff. Ready for this year.
   
   My learning does best in a quite and non distracting environment, but sadly thats not how the world works and I'm trying my best to be less distracting and more productive in my school day. In this class it will be a little bit easyer because I enjoy the work I do and the work that others need help with. Today in time if you dont pay attention you will fall behind and that is a promise. Hopefuly tht doesnt happen to me this year. 
   
   As I stated distractions are really hard for me to handle and keep up with. I love my friends so much but sometimes they get in the way of me learning. On the other hand they can help me get through some of the harder tasks throughout the year, that is one of the principals of computer science right? Anyway hats off to this year so far maybe next week will be diffrent, fingers crossed.
