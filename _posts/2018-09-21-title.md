Week 1,
   Starting off with this class I think it will be a pretty good and challenging class. Learning new things in the coding is always fun and I'm excited to further my knowledge in this field. This is going to be a hard class and a even harder test. From what we have done so far I'm feeling like I can coast by and do good but I know that is not the case in this class. I'm ready to get into some hard and complicated stuff. Ready for this year.
