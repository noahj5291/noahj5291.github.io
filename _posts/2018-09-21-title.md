Week 1,
   Starting off with this class I think it will be a pretty good and challenging class. Learning new things in the coding is always fun and I'm excited to further my knowledge in this field. This is going to be a hard class and a even harder test. From what we have done so far I'm feeling like I can coast by and do good but I know that is not the case in this class. I'm ready to get into some hard and complicated stuff.
   
   My learning does best in a quite and non distracting environment, but sadly thats not how the world works. I'm trying my best to be less distracting ,and more productive in my school day. In this class it will be a little bit easier because I enjoy the work I do and the work that others need help with. Today in time if you don't pay attention you will fall behind and that is a promise. Hopefuly that doesn't happen to me this year. 
   
   As I stated distractions are really hard for me to handle. I love my friends so much but sometimes they get in the way of my education. On the other hand they can help me get through some of the harder tasks throughout the year. That is one of the principals of computer science right? Anyway hats off to this year so far, maybe next week will be diffrent and more difficult.
