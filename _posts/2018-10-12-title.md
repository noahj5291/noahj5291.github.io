 This week was a short but sweet week. we started off the week on thursday for me because i was sick on wednesday. On thursday we used paired programming to solve problems and then on friday we went over the structure of these reflections.
 
 On thursday we used pair programming to use two minds on one problem. The driver guides the mouse and keyboard and types in the code.
 The Navagator takes the problem and works it out in there mind and helps the driver code. I was the driver and I helped the Navagator  understand what to do while coding the circle in the rectangle in Pyret. Then we switched and Gabriel helped me understand the next problem while I thought about it more deeply and what it actually wanted. 
 
 On Friday we went over the structre of these weekly refections, and gave some constructive to some people. After we set some rules about the things we enter and dont enter in these reflections. We have to enter the learning we do and then we have to talk about the learning I did. Then I wrote this reflection.
