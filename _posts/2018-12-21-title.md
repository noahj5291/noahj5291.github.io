## Describe your program

I designed a flag for the United Kingdom, and I expect a professional grade on this project because I was able to utilize proportions to create a vector image that can be increased size


## Current output

## Describe your process.


When I started this project I came across a problem with layering and which layer went first. I went through this program and finally thought to myself what what the first layer and then worked from there. Later as I thought about Vector Images Mr. Allata asked if I could make it so that if I change one number in the code that the would produce the same image. Then I put all the proportions in the fractions according to the height of the image.


## Explain your code.
```

height = 300
length = 5/3 * height
dlength = 2 * height
dwidth = 1/10 * dlength
```
-   Explain each argument in the code section. _then delete this instruction_
In this part we see the varibles being made acording to the height of the current flag. On line one we see height being defined as a number because it will be used to define rectangles and shapes in the flag. Length is then defined as 5/3 for height (300) because the UK flag is a 5/3 flag and the length is 5/3 the size of the height. Dlength is a length of the diagonal shapes becausae the length needs to be longer because the digonals are larger than vertical and horizontal lines of the flag. The dwidth help find the proportions for the digonal lines and they are 1/10 the dlength because the white diagonals are divided by 10ths for the proportions. By themselves they are just values but when you use them in place image functions and shape configuration they size the shapes to match the protortions according to the height.
* * *

```
BR =rectangle(length,height,"solid","dark-blue")
WR =rectangle(length,height / 3,"solid","white")
VWR =rectangle(length / 5,height,"solid","white")
DWR1 =rectangle(dlength,height / 5,"solid","white")
DWR2 =rectangle(dlength,height / 5,"solid","white")
DRR1 =rectangle(dlength / 2,dwidth / 3,"solid","red")
DRR2 =rectangle(dlength / 2,dwidth / 3,"solid","red")
DRR3 =rectangle(dlength / 2,dwidth / 3,"solid","red")
DRR4 =rectangle(dlength / 2,dwidth / 3,"solid","red")
VS =rectangle(dwidth,height,"solid","red")
HS =rectangle(length,height / 5,"solid","red")
```

* * *

In all these definitions they each do a very similar thing. The first argument in each line is the length, this length is meant to be 5/3 of the image height. The second argument of each funtion is the heigth that is accorind to the protortions of the shapes placement and size in the whole flag. The third argument is "solid", this allows the colors to be solid and visable. The last argument is the color of the solid shape. These all together create a shape that is used to make the over all flag.
 



## Program code

```
include image
height = 300
length = 5/3 * height
dlength = 2 * height
dwidth = 1/10 * dlength
BR =rectangle(length,height,"solid","dark-blue")
WR =rectangle(length,height / 3,"solid","white")
VWR =rectangle(length / 5,height,"solid","white")
DWR1 =rectangle(dlength,height / 5,"solid","white")
DWR2 =rectangle(dlength,height / 5,"solid","white")
DRR1 =rectangle(dlength / 2,dwidth / 3,"solid","red")
DRR2 =rectangle(dlength / 2,dwidth / 3,"solid","red")
DRR3 =rectangle(dlength / 2,dwidth / 3,"solid","red")
DRR4 =rectangle(dlength / 2,dwidth / 3,"solid","red")
VS =rectangle(dwidth,height,"solid","red")
HS =rectangle(length,height / 5,"solid","red")



st =place-image(rotate(30,DWR1),1/2 * length,1/2 * height,BR)
nd =place-image(rotate(150,DWR2),1/2 * length,1/2 * height,st)
rd =place-image(rotate(150,DRR1),1/5 * length,1/4 * height,nd)
th =place-image(rotate(30,DRR2),15/20 * length,13/60 * height,rd)
f =place-image(rotate(150,DRR3),89/100 * length,5/6 * height,th)
s =place-image(rotate(30,DRR4),1/5 * length,5/6 * height,f)
se =place-image(WR,1/2 * length,1/2 * height,s)
e =place-image(VWR,1/2 * length,1/2 * height,se)
n =place-image(VS,1/2 * length,1/2 * height,e)
UKFLAG =place-image(HS,1/2 * length,1/2 * height,n)
```
