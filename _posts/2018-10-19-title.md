![Flag of Amsterdam](/images/noah.png)

  This week was a long week, We went over our flags from last week and saw how we could make them better and finish them.  On wednesday we talked about the test and we finished our flags. On thursday we created an image directory for our websites and place the product of our code on our site(the flag above this writing). We also used markdown to get it to apear. On friday we put code into our site for us to anaylise for this refelction. 

  On Monday we worked on our flags. That day we went over some of the thing we learned last week with place-image and other tags to use in Pyret. As a class we went to the computers and tryed to code a simple rectangle with cirlces on it. Then after we worked on our flags. When creating my flag I ran into a problem. My flag has these three X's and I didnt know how to rotate them 
   ```
   FLAG =place-image(rotate(40,WR6),450,150,st2)
   ```
this code right here solved my problem, you see that the place-image function allows me to place a image on another image. So I'm placeing image WR6 onto st2. So I use Place-image to stack them basically. Next I put rotate and the amount of angle I want to rotate in front of the Image I want to put at an angle. Then the produce is at askew for 40 degrees because it is in the place-image, and rotate produces and image so it can be replaced in place Image as an image.
