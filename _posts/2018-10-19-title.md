  This week was a long week, We went over our flags from last week and saw how we could make them better and finish them.  On wednesday we talked about the test and we finished our flags. On thursday we created an image directory for our websites and place the product of our code on our site(the flag above this writing). We also used markdown to get it to apear. On friday we put code into our site for us to anaylise for this refelction. 

  On Monday we worked on our flags. That day we went over some of the thing we learned last week with place-image and other tags to use in Pyret. As a class we went to the computers and tryed to code a simple rectangle with cirlces on it. Then after we worked on our flags. When creating my flag I ran into a problem. My flag has these three X's and I didnt know how to rotate them 
   ```
   FLAG =place-image(rotate(40,WR6),450,150,st2)
   ```
this code right here solved my problem, you see that the place-image function allows me to place a image on another image. So I'm placeing image WR6 onto st2. So I use Place-image to stack them basically. Next I put rotate and the amount of angle I want to rotate in front of the Image I want to put at an angle. Then the produce is at askew for 40 degrees because it is in the place-image, and rotate produces and image so it can be replaced in place Image as an image. 

On Wednesday we finished our Flags by making the last finishing touches by switching angles and and making sure the measurments are right. I tryed to make sure the place images were right and made sence to the overall way of thinking. 
```
st =place-image(BR,300,150,RR)
nd =place-image(rotate(40,WR),300,150,st)
rd =place-image(rotate(-40,WR2),300,150,nd)
th =place-image(rotate(-40,WR3),150,150,rd)
th2 =place-image(rotate(40,WR4),150,150,th)
st2 =place-image(rotate(-40,WR5),450,150,th2)
FLAG =place-image(rotate(40,WR6),450,150,st2)
```
This is something I thought of this week and I want to remember in upcoming units. How could I make this less work? Could I make this a function? Right now I cant answer those questions ,but I'm ready to find out and advance my coding skills. 

On Thursday we wanted to see how we could put our work into our websites. We thought of how to do so and then Mr.Allata gva eus this little booklet about markdown and we used an example of code to help us plug our work in. We created a Image directory to hold these varibles and them inserted this code
```
![FLAG OF AMSTERDAM](/images/noah.png)
```
How this works is that we give the image a name which is in the first brackets and then we call a folder. In this case I called the image folder to pull out a file of Noah.png. This caused the flag at the top to be possible

On Friday we capped up the week and finished with a great reflective talk about the week and what will happen next week. I also did this reflection On friday. That was my week in AP CSP.
