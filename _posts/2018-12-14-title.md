![Flag of The United Kingdom](/images/noahj.png)

  This week in computer Science we worked a lot on making clear code for our new flags. I had to code the flag of Great Britain
and researched the meaning of the flag. The red is the only color for saint george ofr his great for the country. This flag is a 5:3 variant so it is 500 by 300 flag.

 One big thing I focused on was the layering in which the shapes went down on the blue background. At first I thought the white horizontial   and vertical lines went first. Then as i went into coding and working I noticed the diagnalas needed to be coded first 
 ```
 st =place-image(rotate(30,DWR1),250,150,BR)
nd =place-image(rotate(150,DWR2),250,150,st)
rd =place-image(rotate(150,DRR1),100,75,nd)
th =place-image(rotate(30,DRR2),360,75,rd)
f =place-image(rotate(150,DRR3),445,250,th)
s =place-image(rotate(30,DRR4),140,225,f)
se =place-image(WR,250,150,s)
e =place-image(VWR,250,150,se)
n =place-image(VS,250,150,e)
UKFLAG =place-image(HS,250,150,n)
```
  We see that the DWR1 was first which means the diagonal white rectangle 1. We see it was first because the rest of the image was produced on the base of the diagonal lines. We know this because ther is a white space between the diagonal red lines and the horizontal white line.
  
  Through this project i thoguht about the idea of simplifying code so I wont have to do the math myself for the proportions. I used varibles to help make the proportions of each piece. 
  ```
height = 300
length = 500
dlength = 700
dwidth = 60
BR =rectangle(length,height,"solid","dark-blue")
WR =rectangle(length,height / 3,"solid","white")
VWR =rectangle(length / 5,height,"solid","white")
DWR1 =rectangle(dlength,height / 5,"solid","white")
DWR2 =rectangle(dlength,height / 5,"solid","white")
DRR1 =rectangle(dlength / 2,dwidth / 3,"solid","red")
DRR2 =rectangle(dlength / 2,dwidth / 3,"solid","red")
DRR3 =rectangle(dlength / 2,dwidth / 3,"solid","red")
DRR4 =rectangle(dlength / 2,dwidth / 3,"solid","red")
VS =rectangle(60,300,"solid","red")
HS =rectangle(length,height / 5,"solid","red")
  ```
  Height, lenght Refer to the things that are not diagonal. The dlength and dwidth refer tot he diagonal lengths and widths because they are of different values and ways of working. I use these varibles to change the proportions of different lines on the image so that it will be proportional to the flag that is right. I divde and ,multiply by th3e numbers in the protorins and get the product of the UK flag.
