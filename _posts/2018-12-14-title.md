![Flag of The United Kingdom](/images/noahj.png)

  This week in computer Science we worked a lot on making clear code for our new flags. I had to code the flag of Great Britain
and researched the meaning of the flag. The red is the only color for saint george ofr his great for the country. This flag is a 5:3 variant so it is 500 by 300 flag.

 One big thing I focused on was the layering in which the shapes went down on the blue background. At first I thought the white horizontial   and vertical lines went first. Then as i went into coding and working I noticed the diagnalas needed to be coded first 
 ```
 st =place-image(rotate(30,DWR1),250,150,BR)
nd =place-image(rotate(150,DWR2),250,150,st)
rd =place-image(rotate(150,DRR1),100,75,nd)
th =place-image(rotate(30,DRR2),360,75,rd)
f =place-image(rotate(150,DRR3),445,250,th)
s =place-image(rotate(30,DRR4),140,225,f)
se =place-image(WR,250,150,s)
e =place-image(VWR,250,150,se)
n =place-image(VS,250,150,e)
UKFLAG =place-image(HS,250,150,n)
```
  We see
